# Exact continuum representation of long-range interacting systems
An implementation of the exact continuum representation for long-range interacting lattices provided for three highly relevant physical examples. In the first example, we compute interaction energies in Skyrmions in a two-dimensional Heisenberg spin lattice with dipolar long-range interactions. The second examples illustrates that our respresentation readily extends to nonlinear systems. We compute the full nonlinear Coulomb forces in an ion chain with topological defects. In the final example 3, we compute dipole forces in a spin wave in a 3D pyrochlore lattice. We demonstrate that our method allows for an efficient and precise computation of the system properties, where the standard integral approximation is either imprecise or, in case of example 3, yields qualitatively incorrect results.
